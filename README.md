<h2>Smart Methods of Leporellion (SMOL)</h2>
<small>The word Leporellion is derived from 'Leporello', a booklet of fonts and glyphs that the Mayans used for logging. The glyphs are commonly referred to as Runicons. Runicons are provided as implementable Runicodes. The founder, Jens T. Hinrichs, was inspired by the motif 'When the critic is silent, the world must speak in glyphs'.<br>SMOL is a notation language that can be written and read from left to right, or vice versa. SMOL transform the LATIN ALPHABET into an universal ABC. The final task is to write in a universal and non-verbal notation but spelling it in intercultural dialects or national languages. Smart Methods of Leporellion (SMOL) are NewMorse (v3), VisualBraille (9-dot), Ideogrammar and Wellish paired with syllables, logograms, emoticons, glyphs, abbreviation and smart messages.
Use a UNICODE reference to work with simple SMOL in a Text- or HTML-Editor without using Fonts or Glyphs. To show RUNICODES correctly on the Internet, you must have the appropriate UTF referenced in your HTML, so that the specific ENTITY is implemented directly. In some cases, the correct fonts (NewMorse, VisualBraille, MusicTypewriter) must be installed in your (text) editor. I prefer a noSQL database (.csv, .tsv). Use other files (.pdf, .xlsx) at your own purpose. This will continue to include a Complete RUNICONS Reference and Basic Leporellion Charset, while continuing the motto: Keeping it SMOL! Note, please share the original source and do not conquer over SMOL alone! </small>

<small>And that’s far from the end. To date, SMOL has grown to 2,417 notations and is still hungry for more. SMOL ...</small><br>
<li>include a dozen ways of expression except those of a conventional Alphabet!</li>
<li>offers types of composing do without pronunciation!</li>
<li>can be universal coded for more cases of application!</li>
<hr>
<h3>VisualBraille</h3>
<li>using 9-dot was to effect an economy in layout and sign replication</li>
<li>read dot by dot through 3 columns and 3 rows: 1st column (dot 1,2,3), 2nd column (dot 4,5,6), 3rd column (dot 7, 8, 9)</li>
<li>is not compatible with a refreshable braille display which has 8 dots in 4 rows</li>
<li>in the use of numerical letters we are more flexible</li>
<li>we implement the experience in dealing with Traffic Signs in NewMorse (v2)</li>
<li>the Basic Sign act as proxies to help us access the whole Basic Latin charset</li>
<li>keeping the usual spelling and dot stamping in the color black instead of sensible stamping</li>
<li>it doesn't matter if we prefer capitalization with a preceded capital sign</li>
<li>the important difference to 6-dot Braille:  </li>
<h3>MusicTypewriter 1 a/b for Piano</h3>
<li>an introduction in the Law of Octaves by using an consonantal/alphanumeric Alphabet</li>
<li>a piano has 88 keys thereof 52 are white whereby each full octaves has 5 black and 7 white keys (c, d, e, f, g, a, b)</li>
<li>the conventional Alphabet has 26 letters so that using the first white 26 keys for upper cases / starting a new sentence / beginning a word (A - Z ) and the others for lower cases (a - z)</li>
<li>black keys used for vowels (a, e, i, o, u) then adding these to each upper and lower cases so that black keys always representing a pair of consonants and vowels</li>
<li>for flat notes we put vowels first (e.g. ub, ib), for sharp notes we put vowels after (e.g. Au, ai)</li>
<li>for frequent syllables (-ing, -ed), pronouns (he, she, it, you, ...), common words (to, be, or, and, from, for, of, are, have, had) and literal characters (ae, oe, ch, sch, st) we should build chords</li>
<li>trigger the full notes for A to Z with SHIFT, flat/sharp notes corresponding letter A to Z press ALT-SHIFT</li>
<li>trigger the full notes for a to z without SHIFT, flat/sharp notes corresponding letter a to z press ALT</li>
<li>combination ALT and number keys 1 to 9, 0 and ß write only flat/sharp notes corresponding to consonantal keying 45 to 88 (mid to right)</li>
<li>combination ALT-SHIFT and number keys 1 to 9 and 0 write flat/sharp notes corrensponding to consonantal keying 0 to 45 (left to mid)</li>
<li>at the end font contains 124 glyphs thereof visualized tones that represents 52 white keys and 2 times 36 black keys</li>
<li>instead of connecting staves we highlight the chords in colors or underline them</li>
<li>option 1a uses a 9-dot stamping with subtext so that the written composition shows piano keying and the octaves at the same time</li>
<li>option 1b uses a Shortcode that represents the regular notes assigned to the number of keys whereby the corresponding Alphabet is not be displayed</i> 
<li>we can ignore bass and treple clef, because we are using a font instead of sheets of music!</li>
<h3>MusicTypewriter+</h3>
<li>is a non-binding format: fraction.variable(t) fraction.variable(v) (...) fraction.variable(m)</li>
<li>points should be omitted then nesting the alphanumeric notes (a1, ais1) in parenthesis like a mathematical term</li>
<li>also put chords and frequently syllables in a term for later copy and paste</li>  
<li>working with variables (v=value, m=mute, t=tact-time) and fractions (1/1, 1/2, and so on)</li>
<li>version follows the consonantal arrangement on a Piano, each letter and flat/sharp notes has a strict formular: c'=1/c''(X) ... e'=10/9d'(Z), f'=16/15e'(a), fis'=25/24f'(ai), ges'=24/25g'(ib) ... a'=10/9(c) ... a''=2a'(j) and so on </li>
<li>the rules can be applied to Guitar strings and stick/pedal operater for Drums/Percussions, but with a smaller range of the Law of Octaves!</li>
<h3>Prophecy Symbols</h3>
<li>inclusion of prophecy symbols written line by line</li>
<li>using prophecy symbols as dialectical Runicons or solution word in SMOL instead of letters</li>
<li>notation can be read from both left and right to improve understanding between different cultures</li>
<li>horizontal mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, and hexagrams form a special Ideogrammar, e.g. nouns, phrase</li>
<li>Monograms can have similarities to the traditional Morsecode (dit-dah)</li>
<li>established charset supports simple Runicodes</li>
<li>some characters (not highlighted) are already used in other contexts, e.g. social buttons, punctuation</li>
<li>replace num with standard Unicode to display equivalent HTML Entity:  &#num;</li>
<h3>Regular encoding NewMorse (v3) in dit, dah, doh</h3>
<li>is a rearrangement of traditional Morsecode that eliminates language conflicts</li>
<li>notation of monograms replaced with vertical DIT and DAH</li>
<li>space between them are one DIT long, one DAH is two DIT long, word spacing is three DIT long</li>
<li>use a horizontal DOH to put the character in a different context, e.g. preceded traffic signs, vocal letters and inverted punctuation</li>
<li>letters have approximately four signs, punctuation has up to six and numbers have only five</li>
<li>the law of arrangement is SMOL approved, also because we can translate DIT and DAH with binary Morsecode 0 and 1 (bits)</li>
<li>notation presented here can be read from left to right, but can be easily rearranged where the Runicons are reflected horizontally </li> 
<li>the development of NewMorse brought forth new traffic signs and its own grammar keying known as Basic Leporellion charset</li>
<li>CSS/Character Mapping and Typefont NewMorse (v3) Regular Formatting are available – ask me for!</li>
<li>handwritten if you like, e.g. use the punctuation, HTML Entities (NewMorse+) or binary Morsecode (NewMorse++) as equivalent</li>
<h3>Handwritten encoding NewMorse+ in dots and dashes</h3>
<li>is a manual notation of NewMorse (v3) that eliminates technical troubleshooting with Basic Latin, SVG conversion, Illustrators</li>
<li>notation in RUNICONS replaced with DOTS and DASHES without strict adherences to regular encoding in DIT and DAH</li>
<li>you don’t need to make space between them, just paired charset and word spacing</li>
<li>we are using a horizontal BAR or underline formatting in some cases to put the character in a different context, e.g. capitalization, preceded traffic signs for grammar keying</li>
<li>letters still have approximately four signs, punctuation has up to six and numbers have only five,</li>
<li>but more characters can be triggered by a key or punctuation at the same time</li>
<li>the law of arrangement is SMOL approved, also because we can translate DOTS and DASHES with HTML Entities: &#num;</li>
<li>NewMorse+ and HTML Entities presented here can be read from left to right,</li>
<li>but can be easily rearranged where the characters or RUNICODES are reflected horizontally</li>  
<li>development of NewMorse+ brought forth a more practicable use in Texteditors and HTML</li>
<li>write or draw if you like, e.g. use a well-known punctuation or binary Morsecode (NewMorse++) as equivalent to the font NewMorse (v3)</li>
<li>dots and dashes could also be used to align the arrangement of symbols on top of each other, so to reconcile them with the prophecy symbols (mono-, di-, tri- and tetragrams etc.) – give it a try!</li>
<li>I recommend a sample of preselected key assignment to start with</li>
<h3>Non-binary Encoding NewMorse++ in digits</h3>
<li>is a unusual binary transformation of NewMorse (v3) and NewMorse+</li>
<li>a non-binary encoding of 0 and 1 displace DIT and DAH or DOTS and DASHES</li>
<li>is inconstent with regular bits (8 bits = 1 byte), the eighth digit is called check bit</li>
<li>word spacing is three non-binary 0 long instead of three DITS (traffic sign PAUSE)</li>
<li>we are using preceded capital, number and traffic sign that we are familiar with</li>
<li>to capitalize, you must prefix the letter with a Capital Sign ( 1000101 ) instead of highlighting them with underlines</li> 
<li>letters still have approximately four digits, punctuation has up to six digits and numbers have only five digits</li>
<li>note: there is no relationship to ´regular´ base 10 or ´binary´ base 2 - first and foremost, we would have to translate NewMorse++ into ABC or Basic Leporellion charset and then into machine language (e.g. binary coded decimal numbers from 0 to 9); if you want to use the shortened non-binary characters with numbers, then you have to anticipate a Number Sign ( 1000101 )</li>
<li>the law of arrangement is SMOL approved, also because we only use 0 and 1 as content placeholder instead of a bulk of characters</li>
<li>NewMorse++ presented here can be read from left to right, but had to be rearranged where the digits are reflected horizontally</li>
<li>instead of a binary encoding, we can also use alphabetical RUNICONS (lower case x for 1 and lower case o for 0 on a 3x3 field) - but we favor barrier-free notation without having to install and maintain a font or glyph – read it line by line</li>
<li>the reading direction differs from VisualBraille (row by row in a 3x3 field)</li>
<li>to make it easier to learn, we do not use decorative nor table elements</li>  
<li>NewMorse++ shortened charset and is more practicable for SVG layout or handwritten TEXT formatting</li>
