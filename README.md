<h2>Smart Methods of Leporellion (SMOL)</h2>
<small>SMOL is a notation language that can be written and read from left to right, or vice versa. SMOL transform the LATIN ALPHABET into an universal ABC. The final task is to write in a universal and non-verbal notation but spelling it in intercultural dialects or national languages. Smart Methods of Leporellion (SMOL) are NewMorse (v3), VisualBraille (9-dot), Ideogrammar and Wellish paired with syllables, logograms, emoticons, glyphs, abbreviation and smart messages.
Use a UNICODE reference to work with simple SMOL in a Text- or HTML-Editor without using Fonts or Glyphs. To show RUNICODES correctly on the Internet, you must have the appropriate UTF referenced in your HTML, so that the specific ENTITY is implemented directly. In some cases, the correct fonts (NewMorse, VisualB raille, MusicTypewriter) must be installed in your (text) editor. I prefer a noSQL database (.csv, .tsv). Use other files at your own purpose. This will continue to include a Complete RUNICONS Reference and Basic Leporellion Charset, while continuing the motto: Keeping it SMOL! Note, please share the original source and do not conquer over SMOL alone!</small>

<h3>Prophecy Symbols</h3>
<li>inclusion of prophecy symbols written line by line</li>
<li>using prophecy symbols as dialectical Runicons or solution word in SMOL instead of letters</li>
<li>notation can be read from both left and right to improve understanding between different cultures</li>
<li>horizontal mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, and hexagrams form a special Ideogrammar, e.g. nouns, phrase</li>
<li>Monograms can have similarities to the traditional Morsecode (dit-dah)</li>
<li>established charset supports simple Runicodes</li>
<li>some characters (not highlighted) are already used in other contexts, e.g. social buttons, punctuation</li>
<li>replace num with standard Unicode to display equivalent HTML Entity:  &#num;</li>
<h3>Regular encoding NewMorse (v3) in dit, dah, doh</h3>
<li>is a rearrangement of traditional Morsecode that eliminates language conflicts</li>
<li>notation of monograms replaced with vertical DIT and DAH</li>
<li>space between them are one DIT long, one DAH is two DIT long, word spacing is three DIT long</li>
<li>use a horizontal DOH to put the character in a different context, e.g. preceded traffic signs, vocal letters and inverted punctuation</li>
<li>letters have approximately four signs, punctuation has up to six and numbers have only five</li>
<li>the law of arrangement is SMOL approved, also because we can translate DIT and DAH with binary Morsecode 0 and 1 (bits)</li>
<li>notation presented here can be read from left to right, but can be easily rearranged where the Runicons are reflected horizontally </li> 
<li>the development of NewMorse brought forth new traffic signs and its own grammar keying known as Basic Leporellion charset</li>
<li>CSS/Character Mapping and Typefont NewMorse (v3) Regular Formatting are available – ask me for!</li>
<li>handwritten if you like, e.g. use the punctuation, HTML Entities (NewMorse+) or binary Morsecode (NewMorse++) as equivalent</li>
<h3>Handwritten encoding NewMorse+ in dots and dashes</h3>
<li>is a manual notation of NewMorse (v3) that eliminates technical troubleshooting with Basic Latin, SVG conversion, Illustrators</li>
<li>notation in RUNICONS replaced with DOTS and DASHES without strict adherences to regular encoding in DIT and DAH</li>
<li>you don’t need to make space between them, just paired charset and word spacing</li>
<li>we are using a horizontal BAR or underline formatting in some cases to put the character in a different context, e.g. capitalization, preceded traffic signs for grammar keying</li>
<li>letters still have approximately four signs, punctuation has up to six and numbers have only five,</li>
<li>but more characters can be triggered by a key or punctuation at the same time</li>
<li>the law of arrangement is SMOL approved, also because we can translate DOTS and DASHES with HTML Entities: &#num;</li>
<li>NewMorse+ and HTML Entities presented here can be read from left to right,</li>
<li>but can be easily rearranged where the characters or RUNICODES are reflected horizontally</li>  
<li>development of NewMorse+ brought forth a more practicable use in Texteditors and HTML</li>
<li>write or draw if you like, e.g. use a well-known punctuation or binary Morsecode (NewMorse++) as equivalent to the font NewMorse (v3)</li>
<li>dots and dashes could also be used to align the arrangement of symbols on top of each other, so to reconcile them with the prophecy symbols (mono-, di-, tri- and tetragrams etc.) – give it a try!</li>
<li>I recommend a sample of preselected key assignment to start with</li>
<h3>Binary Encoding NewMorse++ in bits</h3>
<li>is a binary transformation of NewMorse (v3) and NewMorse+</li>
<li>a binary encoding displays DIT and DAH or DOTS and DASHES</li>
<li>we group string into bits (8 bits = 1 byte), the eighth digit is called check bit</li>
<li>word spacing is three binary 0 long instead of three DITS (traffic sign PAUSE)</li>
<li>we are using preceded capital, number and traffic sign that we are familiar with</li>
<li>to capitalize, you must prefix the letter with a Capital Sign ( 1000101 ) instead of highlighting them with underlines</li> 
<li>letters still have approximately four digits, punctuation has up to six digits and numbers have only five digits</li>
<li>there is no relationship to ´regular´ base 10 or ´binary´ base 2 - first and foremost, we would have to translate NewMorse++ into ABC or Basic Leporellion charset and then into machine language (e.g. binary coded decimal numbers from 0 to 9); if you want to use the shortened binary characters, then you have to anticipate a Number Sign ( 1000101 )</li>
<li>the law of arrangement is SMOL approved, also because we only use 0 and 1 as content placeholder instead of a bulk of characters</li>
<li>NewMorse++ presented here can be read from left to right, but had to be rearranged where the digits are reflected horizontally</li>
<li>instead of a binary encoding, we can also use alphabetical RUNICONS (lower case x for 1 and lower case o for 0 on a 3x3 field) - but we favor barrier-free notation without having to install and maintain a font or glyph – read it line by line</li>
<li>NewMorse++ shortened charset and is more practicable for SVG layout or handwritten TEXT formatting</li>
