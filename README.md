<h2>Smart Methods of Leporellion (SMOL)</h2>
<small>Use a UNICODE reference to work with simple SMOL in a Text- or HTML-Editor without using Fonts or Glyphs. To show RUNICODES correctly on the Internet, you must have the appropriate UTF referenced in your HTML, so that the specific ENTITY is implemented directly. SMOL is a notation language that can be written and read from left to right, or vice versa. I prefer a noSQL database (.csv, .tsv). Use other files at your own purpose. The correct fonts must be installed in your (text) editor. This will continue to include a Complete RUNICONS Reference and Basic Leporellion Charset, while continuing the motto: Keeping it SMOL! Note, please share the original source and do not conquer over SMOL alone!</small>

<h3>Prophecy Symbols</h3>
<li>⋅ inclusion of prophecy symbols written line by line</li>
<li>⋅ using prophecy symbols as dialectical Runicons or solution word in SMOL instead of letters</li>
<li>⋅ notation can be read from both left and right to improve understanding between different cultures</li>
<li>⋅ horizontal mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, and hexagrams form a special Ideogrammar, e.g. nouns, phrase</li>
<li>⋅ Monograms can have similarities to the traditional Morsecode (dit-dah)</li>
<li>⋅ established charset supports simple Runicodes</li>
<li>⋅ some characters (not highlighted) are already used in other contexts, e.g. social buttons, punctuation</li>
<li>⋅ replace num with standard Unicode to display equivalent HTML Entity:  &#num;</li>
<h3>NewMorse (v3)</h3>
<li>⋅ is a rearrangement of traditional Morsecode that eliminates language conflicts</li>
<li>⋅ notation of monograms replaced with vertical DIT and DAH</li>
<li>⋅ space between them are one DIT long, one DAH is two DIT long, word spacing is three DIT long</li>
<li>⋅ use a horizontal DOH to put the character in a different context, e.g. preceded traffic signs, vocal letters and inverted punctuation</li>
<li>⋅ letters have approximately four signs, punctuation has up to six and numbers have only five</li>
<li>⋅ the law of arrangement is SMOL approved, also because we can translate DIT and DAH with binary Morsecode 0 and 1 (bits)</li>
<li>⋅ notation presented here can be read from left to right, but can be easily rearranged where the Runicons are reflected horizontally</li>  
<li>⋅ the development of NewMorse brought forth new traffic signs and its own grammar keying known as Basic Leporellion charset</li>
<li>⋅ CSS/Character Mapping and Typefont NewMorse (v3) Regular Formatting are available – ask me for</li>
<li>⋅ handwritten if you like, e.g. use the punctuation, HTML Entities (NewMorse+) or binary Morsecode (NewMorse++) as equivalent</li>
<h3>NewMorse+</h3>
<li>⋅ is a manual notation of NewMorse (v3) that eliminates technical troubleshooting with Basic Latin, SVG conversion, Illustrators</li>
<li>⋅ notation in RUNICONS replaced with DOTS and DASHES without strict adherences to regular encoding in DIT and DAH</li>
<li>⋅ you don’t need to make space between them, just paired charset and word spacing</li>
<li>⋅ use a underline format (BAR) in some cases to put the them in a different context, e.g. upper case, traffic signs for grammar</li>
<li>⋅ letters still have approximately four signs, punctuation has up to six and numbers have only five,</li> 
<li>⋅ but more characters can be triggered by a key or punctuation at the same time</li>  
<li>⋅ the law of arrangement is SMOL approved, also because we can translate DOTS and DASHES with HTML Entities: &#num;</li>
<li>⋅ NewMorse+ and HTML Entities presented here can be read from left to right,</li> 
<li>⋅ but can be easily rearranged where the characters or RUNICODES are reflected horizontally</li>  
<li>⋅ development of NewMorse+ brought forth a more practicable use in Texteditors and HTML</li>
<li>⋅ write or draw if you like, e.g. use a well-known punctuation or binary Morsecode (NewMorse++) as equivalent to the font family</li>
<li>⋅ dots and dashes could also be used to align the arrangement of symbols on top of each other,</li> 
<li>⋅ so to reconcile them with the prophecy symbols (mono-, di-, tri- and tetragrams etc.) – give it a try!</li>
<li>⋅ I recommend a sample of preselected key assignment to start with</li>
