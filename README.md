<h2>Smart Methods of Leporellion (SMOL)</h2>
<small>Use a UNICODE reference to work with simple SMOL in a Text- or HTML-Editor without using Fonts or Glyphs. To show RUNICODES correctly on the Internet, you must have the appropriate UTF referenced in your HTML, so that the specific ENTITY is implemented directly. SMOL is a notation language that can be written and read from left to right, or vice versa. I prefer a noSQL database (.csv, .tsv). Use other files at your own purpose. This will continue to include a Complete RUNICONS Reference and Basic Leporellion Charset, while continuing the motto: Keeping it SMOL! Note, please share the original source and do not conquer over SMOL alone!</small>
